# Lua with CMake Support
Unaltered [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) source code and documentation with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build infrastructure. This repository contains Lua Version 5.4.7 sources extracted from https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.4.7.tar.gz. Tested generators and architectures are:

- Visual Studio 17 2022, Win32
- Visual Studio 17 2022, x64

**Notice:** Present `Makefiles` originate from Lua source code archive and are not used within the context of CMake-based build.

## Windows Tool Chain Preparation

A complete Microsoft Visual Studio Installation is optional but not strictly necessary. Simply install **Buildtools for Visual Studio 2022** from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022 and select  the following minimum components for download and installation:

- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++-x64/x86-Buildtools
- C++-CMake-Tools for Windows
- Windows 11-SDK (10.0.22621.0) 

## Building and Installing Lua

Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and change drive and directory. Download and unpack sources or simply clone this repository:

```cmd
c:
cd c:\Temp
git clone git@github.com:KritzelKratzel/lua.git
cd lua
```

CMake strongly encourages out-of-source builds.

```cmd
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A <arch>
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
```

Replace `<arch>` with your desired architecture. Available architectures with selected `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator are `Win32`, `x64`, `ARM` and `ARM64`. Default installation directory is `C:/Apps/lua-5.4.7` where a directory structure according to [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html) is created:

- `bin`: Lua binaries `lua.exe` and `luac.exe`, both statically linked, no DLL dependency,
- `include`: Public header files,
- `lib`: Lua static library `liblua.lib`,
- `share`: documentation, man-pages, CMake configuration.

The default installation path can be overwritten by using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` at the command line during CMake configuration. Example:

```cmd
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\Foo\Bar"
```

Finally add the path to Lua to Windows search path for executables. 

```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Apps\lua-5.4.7\bin"
```

Open an new command window and test lua. Use `CTRL-C` to leave Lua in interactive mode.

```cmd
C:\Users\John Doe>lua
Lua 5.4.7  Copyright (C) 1994-2024 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> print(_VERSION)
Lua 5.4
>
C:\Users\John Doe>
